IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:

1. My classes BloomFilter and BitArray are copied from another university project, and
specifically from Operating Systems with A.Delis.
Only change made was about the size that you give in the Description of the Exercise (100KBytes).
No other change made since their use was exactly what I needed for here too.

2. For virusesFile and countriesFile, I assume for reasons of simplicity that each
country and each virus has an one-word name ex 'France' and NOT 'Northern Ireland'
